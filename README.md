# Autism-Tracker
An application built at Save The Hacker at Freshdesk from 5-7th May 2017.

The application tracks and monitors the change in emotion of the autistic child and there after notifies the parent about the change and tries to calm the child by opening a specific application or game to calm the child.
The emotion is monitored by means of dataset trained in TensorFlow and Keras as well with help from the Microsoft Oxform Vision API which analyses and runs in the backend.
The application has a hiddnn camera feature that runs as a background service to capture the pitcure at a regular interval.
